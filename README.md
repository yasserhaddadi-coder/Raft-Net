Code for the paper : RaFT-Net: Radiomics Feature-Token Network for Non-Invasive Breast Cancer Hormone Receptor Status Prediction from DCE-MRI
RaFT-Net (Radiomics Feature-Token Network) is presented for the non-invasive
prediction of hormone receptor (HR) status in breast cancer directly using DCE-MRI. Cancer regions are
processed and analyzed through three parallel feature flows: deep CNN features generated using a ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet-B0 ensemble; radiomic parameters detecting texture and morphology via
PyRadiomics (107 features per timepoint); and structured clinical metadata. These complementary modalities are
merged, PCA-compressed to 44 principal components, and filtred using SelectKBest (k = 30) before going to the
RaFT-Net architecture, which includes feature-token self-attention, a residual feature tower, and an MC Dropout
classification block. A SimCLR contrastive pre-training stage employs all available imaging data, including
unlabelled patients. The complex ensemble (RaFT-Net, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM) classifies patients into
HR− (HER2-positive or triple-negative) or HR+ (hormone receptor positive), assisting endocrine therapy
planning without biopsy. The proposed appraoch achieves AUC = 0.929, accuracy = 87.1%, sensitivity = 0.850,
and specificity = 0.917 under LOOCV on the Breast-MRI-NACT-Pilot dataset.
